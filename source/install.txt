Quickstart
==========

You have to use docker to run Soapower.

.. code-block:: sh
    docker run -i -d -p 49010:9010 t -v /data/soapower/mongodb:/data/db -v /data/soapower/backups:/opt/soapower/backups yesnault/docker-soapower:200


Check Installation
------------------

* Go to http://localhost:49010


Tips
-----

* You can forward port of mongoDB -p 49011:29017 
* There is a backup of configuration in directory /data/soapower/backups. The backup is made by a job in the crontab (at 23h30)
* If you forward the ssh port -p 49012:22, you can connect to your container with :
.. code-block:: sh
    ssh admin@localhost -p 49012
    sudo su #to become root in the container
